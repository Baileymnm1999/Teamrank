# What is this?
This project was an attempt to kill two birds with one stone. At the time I was taking my databases class my sophmore year, I also participated in a Rocket League esports league. I was member to a "Power Rankings" committee within this league. With Teamrank I hoped to satisfy my databases project requirments while also building a nice tool to use in our committee. We ultimately never ended up using this as I did not get rank voting implemented, but I still think it made for a nice project.
